## Description
With warm weather fast approaching here in Denver, I was inspired to create an app that would help folks organize their upcoming cookouts. No more showing up at 6 only to realize grilling started at 3 and the food is cold or gone. No more having 4 different potato salads and no burgers. Cookout Companion allows you to create an event with a time, location, description, and list of attendees. Once created, users will be able to add food and drinks to the event, ensuring all of your bases are covered. Users can then reference any cookout to ensure they know when, where, and what to bring.
